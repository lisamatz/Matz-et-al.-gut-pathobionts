First, install MaAsLin2 according to the instructions at https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/maaslin/. We used MaAsLin2 version 1.14.1.

Next, load the library:

```{r}
library(Maaslin2)
```

The data and metadata files are in the repository. We'll load them both as dataframes.

```{r}
data = read.table(file = "TAB ASV_No Rarefaction ASVs from MJ format input LefSe.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = 1, header = TRUE)
data
```

```{r}
metadata = read.table(file = "TAB IRB Human Metadata.tsv", sep = "\t", row.names = 1, header = TRUE)
metadata
```

```{r}
fit_data = Maaslin2(
    input_data = data, 
    input_metadata = metadata, 
    output = "output", 
    fixed_effects = c("diabetes.status"))
```
